ventoy installer didn't work hjsbdjbsdfd, not with `.iso` or `.img` file. yet a balenaetcher-flashed USB managed to do the trick, using the `.iso` downloaded from Netgate.

can get this `.iso` via (slow) mirrors as outlined [here](https://forums.lawrencesystems.com/t/no-longer-available-iso-image-for-pfsense/21391/8), if you want to avoid the netgate store song and dance/bullshit (why on earth should a community edition software require me to create a netgate store account, enter my "address" and phone number, and "purchase" a product for $0.00 ...?)
